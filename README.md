# Algorithms-in-Python
Here, I have implemented some of the basic data structures and algorithms in Python.

Books that I followed while doing this are:
1. Introduction to Algorithms - by Cormen, Leiserson, Rivest and Stein
2. Data Structures and Algorithms in Python - by Goodrich, Tamassia and Goldwasser.
